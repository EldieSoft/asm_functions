This is a simple assembly program I made to practice using external functions in x64 assembly.
This code comes from the book "Beginning x64 Assembly Programming" by Jo Van Hoey, Chapter 14
I hope this code can be used by others to learn assembly as well, because asm programming is becoming a dying art.

To compile the code in the linux terminal, copy the code into a new directory (eg. asm_functions), then change working directory to said directory. Type 'make', and the makefile will do it's job.
(NASM and GCC must be installed, or else the program will not compile)

Can you make the code more efficient? Can you add functions to the files? I hope this will help spark more interest in this complicated, yet rewarding, low level language.
Have fun!!
