This is a simple assembly program I made to practice using external functions in x64 assembly.
This code comes from the book "Beginning x64 Assembly Programming" by Jo Van Hoey, Chapter 14
I hope this code can be used by others to learn assembly as well, because asm programming is becoming a dying art.
